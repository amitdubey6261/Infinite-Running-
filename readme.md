**Infinite Running** is a Three.js project inspired by endless runner games like *Subway Surfers*. It features a dynamically generated environment where the player continuously moves forward, dodging obstacles and collecting rewards.

The core gameplay loop emphasizes fast-paced action, smooth character movement, and procedurally created terrain to ensure variety and replayability.
